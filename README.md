# Engagement on a Digital Mental Health Platform

This repository contains the code for the study titled:

**"User Character Strengths Predict Engagement on a DigitalMental Health Platform for Young People: Longitudinal Observational Study"**

## Overview

This study investigates how **character strengths** influence **user engagement** with *moderated online social therapy* — a digital mental health platform offering individualized, evidence-based treatment for young people aged 12–25 in Australia.

With data from **6,967 users** enrolled between August 2021 and July 2023, we explored whether character strengths across three dimensions — **social harmony**, **positive determination**, and **courage and creativity** — predicted:
- **Dropout rates** over time
- **Usage patterns** during the first 12 weeks after onboarding

## Key Findings

- **Social Harmony** predicted higher *initial engagement*, but faster **dropout** and declining use over 12 weeks.
- **Positive Determination** and **Courage & Creativity** predicted lower *initial use*, but **steadier, sustained engagement**.
- No significant associations were found for use of the social network or messaging with clinical teams.

These findings highlight how individual character strengths shape **distinct engagement trajectories**, with implications for **personalizing digital mental health platforms**.
